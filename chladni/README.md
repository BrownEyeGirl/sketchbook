## Description

> *VARIATION JAM - MUSIC VISUALIZER ALGORITHM* simulates Chladni sand patterns and synchs them up with the frequencies of a song. The size, colour, and arrangement of the sand is determined by the frequencies picked up by an FFT frequency analyzer making this algorithm universal and not limited to the songs I've provided
> Click play song 1, 2, or 3 to stop/start the program. 
> LOOKING FORWARD: I am working on developing an algorithm that takes desktop audio input using other javascript libraries so I can display it in my house. I will keep updating it.
